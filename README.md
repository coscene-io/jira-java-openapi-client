*Automatically generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech)*

## Requirements

Building the API client library requires:

1. Java 1.8+
2. Maven (3.8.3+)/Gradle (7.2+)

## Installation

To install the API client library to your local Maven repository, simply execute:

```shell
mvn clean install
```

To deploy it to a remote Maven repository instead, configure the settings of the repository and execute:

```shell
mvn clean deploy
```

Refer to the [OSSRH Guide](http://central.sonatype.org/pages/ossrh-guide.html) for more information.

### Maven users

Add this dependency to your project's POM:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.coscene</groupId>
    <artifactId>jira-openapi-java-client</artifactId>
    <version>${jiraClientVersion}</version>
</dependency>
```

### Gradle users

Add this dependency to your project's build file:

```groovy
repositories {
    maven {
        name = "jira-java-openapi-client"
        url = uri("https://maven.pkg.github.com/coscene-io/jira-openapi-java-client")
        credentials {
            // Github username
            username = ghUsername
            // Github PAT
            password = ghPassword
        }
        content {
            includeGroup "io.coscene"
        }
    }
}

dependencies {
    implementation "io.coscene:jira-openapi-java-client:${jiraClientVersion}"
}
```

### Others

At first generate the JAR by executing:

```shell
mvn clean package
```

Then manually install the following JARs:

* `target/jira-openapi-java-client-${version}.jar`
* `target/lib/*.jar`

## Getting Started

Please follow the [installation](#installation) instruction and execute the following Java code:

```java

// Import classes:

import io.coscene.jira.client.v3.ApiClient;
import io.coscene.jira.client.v3.ApiException;
import io.coscene.jira.client.v3.Configuration;
import io.coscene.jira.client.v3.auth.*;
import org.openapitools.client.models.*;
import io.coscene.jira.client.v3.api.AnnouncementBannerApi;

public class Example {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    ApiClient defaultClient = Configuration.getDefaultApiClient();
    defaultClient.setBasePath("https://your-domain.atlassian.net");

    // Configure OAuth2 access token for authorization: OAuth2
    OAuth OAuth2 = (OAuth) defaultClient.getAuthentication("OAuth2");
    OAuth2.setAccessToken("YOUR ACCESS TOKEN");

    // Configure HTTP basic authorization: basicAuth
    HttpBasicAuth basicAuth = (HttpBasicAuth) defaultClient.getAuthentication("basicAuth");
    basicAuth.setUsername("YOUR USERNAME");
    basicAuth.setPassword("YOUR PASSWORD");

    AnnouncementBannerApi apiInstance = new AnnouncementBannerApi(defaultClient);
    try {
      AnnouncementBannerConfiguration result = apiInstance.getBanner();
      System.out.println(result);
    } catch (ApiException e) {
      System.err.println("Exception when calling AnnouncementBannerApi#getBanner");
      System.err.println("Status code: " + e.getCode());
      System.err.println("Reason: " + e.getResponseBody());
      System.err.println("Response headers: " + e.getResponseHeaders());
      e.printStackTrace();
    }
  }
}

```
